        This is an experiment in the field of individual decision making.
        In this experiment you can earn real money,
        and your earnings will depend partly on your decisions and partly on chance.
        During the experiment, we will refer to points instead of dollars.
        Your earnings will be calculated in points and later paid to you in money.
    </p>

        100 points = 1 dollar

        Each part is different and has separate instructions.
